## Introduction

The D&D 5th Edition DRS API Database serves as the backend support for the API, allowing users to access and manage Character Sheets based on the Brazilian Portuguese adaptation of the DRS. The API provides various endpoints to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Character Sheets.

## Documentation

For detailed information on how to use the API and interact with the database, please refer to the official API documentation. The documentation includes details about authentication, available endpoints, request/response formats, and usage examples.

//TODO:: In development...

## Getting Started

To set up the API and database locally, follow these steps:
//TODO:: 
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/dnd-5e-drs-api-database.git`
2. Install the required dependencies for your chosen backend technology.
3. Configure the database connection settings in the configuration file.
4. Run the database migration scripts to create the required tables.
5. Start the API server.

## Database Structure

The database is designed to store information related to Character Sheets, including attributes, abilities, and other relevant data. The database schema includes tables such as:
//TODO:: 
- `characters`: Stores information about individual characters, such as name, race, class, and level.
- `abilities`: Stores abilities and traits associated with characters.
- `inventory`: Stores character inventory and equipment details.
- ... (additional tables as needed)

The relationships between these tables ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.

## API Endpoints

The API provides various endpoints to interact with Character Sheets:
//TODO:: 
- `GET /characters`: Retrieve a list of all characters.
- `GET /characters/{id}`: Retrieve details of a specific character.
- `POST /characters`: Create a new character.
- `PUT /characters/{id}`: Update details of a specific character.
- `DELETE /characters/{id}`: Delete a character.

Refer to the API documentation for a comprehensive list of available endpoints, request/response formats, and example usage.
